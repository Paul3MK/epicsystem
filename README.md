# Expo Quickstart
I grew rather tired of having to go through the exact same steps each time I wanted to set up an Expo project, so I'm making a quickstart repo.

It includes:
- Expo Router
- TypeScript
- Google Fonts integration (currently imports Inter)
- SVG support (`import SampleSVG from "./sample.svg"`)
